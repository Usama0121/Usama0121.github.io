## ہم کلام (Hum Kalaam)

An Urdu Text to Speech System that synthesizes Urdu text in the voices of [Dr. Agha Ali Raza](http://aghaaliraza.com/) and [Zia Mohyeddin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zia_Mohyeddin) Sb. 

**Audio Samples:** Synthesized samples are available [here](http://bit.ly/audio-samples)

**Demo:** A web API is in pipeline but a temporary web demo is available [here](http://119.153.105.10:7576/). Expect bugs as we're using it just to test different models
